# Push_Swap
This project was completed in February 2023 as part of the 42 cursus. The project takes a list of unique numbers, and returns a series of instuctions on how to sort them, using a second stack as an auxiliary, doing this process in as few movements as possible.


# Solving the problem
One of the challenges was that for this project, complexity was not measure in number of computations within the program, but in number of instructions, which makes the project very unique and challenging. It requires a good understanding of the mechanics of the of the algorithm we put into practice in order to adapt them to the problem.

# Instructions
• At the beginning:
◦ The stack a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers
which cannot be duplicated.
◦ The stack b is empty.
• The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a. To do so you have the
following operations at your disposal:
